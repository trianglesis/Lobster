### BMC Test Automation framework

Test Framework written by @trianglesis

It runs on:

* Django
* Celery
* RabbitMQ
* Mysql

Integrated to perforce workspace.

Ass some interesting info here, maybe.
 
This is separate development branch.

There are significant difference between, Octopus (live) and Lobster(dev) versions, they're count not be different branches, so I decided to make them as different repos.




Octopus is not published yet.
